The Azure IoT Service SDK for Node.js helps you build applications that interact with your devices and manage their identities in your IoT hub. With the new device management (DM) capabilities, you can interact with your devices in new ways. 

## Installation

```
npm install azure-iothub@latest
```

## Features

* Create/remove/update/list device identities in your IoT hub
* Read auto-sync'd device properties from a DM-enabled device
* Send messages to your devices and get feedback when they're delivered
* Perform common DM tasks on your devices, like upgrading firmware, rebooting, and resetting to factory defaults.
